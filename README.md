# City Clustering
This project was submitted by Shelley Obery and Robert Bozsik as the final project during the Data Analytics Bootcamp of Ironhack Berlin.

# Task:
The goal is to demonstrate the skills the students have built throughout the bootcamp.

# Project details:
We created a city clustering or recommender system, that clusters the capital cities of Europe into 4 clusters based on weather- or socio-economic features, such as number of sunny hours per season, the safety index of a city... etc.

# Features:
 - autumn_prec_mm: precipitaion in autumn in milimters
 - ...
